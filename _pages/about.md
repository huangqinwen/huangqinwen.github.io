I'm currently a PhD at Duke University advised by Professor [Alberto Bartesaghi](http://cryoem.cs.duke.edu/). My research focuses on using machine learning (ML) to automate the data processing pipeline fro cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM), including single particle analysis (SPA) and cryo electron tomography (CET). I'm broadly interested in machine learning for biology, especially its potential applications on cryo-EM and drug discovery. 

I will be joining [Bain & Co](https://www.bain.com/) at San Francisco after graduation. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in cryo-EM, machine learning for biology, drug discovery, or management consulting.
