In the past, researchers studying cellular complexity used a reductionist approach by separating and analyzing individual molecular compoenents. While this "divide-and-conquer" approach has been successful, it is well known that biological functions typically involve the coordinated actions of multiple molecules. Therefore, there is a need for methods to study structures in their native cellular environment (in situ). Cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful imaging technique that can reveal the submolecular structure of cells with minimal disturbance to the cell. This post aims to give readers a brief background introduction of cryo-ET, as well as single particle analysis (SPA) cryo-EM that studies purified protein samples, reviews the latest cryo-ET workflows, and discusses the potential of machine learning and deep learning in cryo-ET.

    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.
